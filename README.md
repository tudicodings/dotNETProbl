Library Management System
  As a library administrator, I need a robust application to efficiently manage the book
  collection. The system must allow adding new titles, removing worn-out ones, and
  facilitating the borrowing process. The administrator should be able to search for books
  using given filters and check their availability for lending.
Requirements:
    1. Backend Implementation: Develop a backend application using C#. The
  architecture should follow a multi-layer model to enhance modularity and future
  scalability.
    2. Data Model Definition: Design the "Book" entity to incorporate book details such
  as ID, title, author, and quantity (feel free to shape the class whichever you want).
    3. Data Persistence: Implement a data storage mechanism using a format of your
  choice (XML, JSON, relational database, text files).
    4. Basic Functionalities: Provide logic for performing CRUD operations (Create,
  Read, Update, Delete) on book records.
    5. Search Functionality: The administrator should have the ability to search for
  books based on specific filters (title, author, etc.).
    6. Book Lending Management Process: Facilitate book lending transactions,
  incorporating sufficient business logic to prevent loans when stock is depleted or
  preventing book returns when all books have been returned.
    7. New Functionality Development: Think of an innovative functionality for this
  application and implement it.
